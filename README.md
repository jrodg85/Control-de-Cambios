Currently, I am studying a degree in military computing at the Academy of Engineers and Transmissions of the Army in Hoyo de Manzanares. I usually develop software on my laptop, and this is for the reason that I am going to explain how to use my personal laptop. My personal laptop travels with me anytime, anywhere. It is one of the things that I keep in my backpack for daily use. In fact, if I plan on not coming homeâ€¦ I'll bring two laptops.

The way to turn on my laptop is very similar to any other laptop, but the big difference between other laptops is that my laptop has two operating systems, Linux and Windows. On the one hand, I use Windows in my free time, for example to play games, surf the internet, make office documents. On the other hand, I use the Linux Operating System to develop software, cybersecurity programs or make reports.

Before pressing the power button, you have to have decided what you are going to use the laptop for. After estp, press the power key, a few seconds later, the bootloader menu will appear on the screen. You will have to choose the correct operating system. If you don't press any keys, the boot loader is preconfigured to initialize the Linux Operating System.

If you have made a mistake in the option or you have decided to change the use. Don't worry, you can restart the laptop and select the correct operating system.
