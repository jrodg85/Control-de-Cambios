Nowadays, I’m studying a military informatic degree in the Engineer and Signals Academia of Spanish Army in Hoyo de Manzanares. I often use developing sofware in my laptop, and for this reason I’ll explain how to use my personal laptop. My personal laptop travel with me anytime ando everywhere. It’s one of the things that I safe in my dayly backpack. In fact, if I haven’t plan to go back to home… I’ll carry two of them.

The way to switch one of my laptop it is very similar than another one, but the big diference between another laptops is that my laptop has two operative systems. Linux and Windows Operative System. For one hand, I use in my free time Windows, for example playing games, surfing internet and making office documents. And the another hand, I use Linux Operative system for develop software, using cibersecrity software or making reports.

Before press de switch on key, you have to be decided what is the use that I’ll do of the laptop. After that, press the switch on key, and in few second appear on the screen a bootloader menú. You have to choose the correct operative system. If you don’t press any key, the bootloader it is preconfigurated to initializer the Linux OS.

If you mistake the opción or you have decided change the use, don’t worry. You can restart the laptop and select the correct Operative System.
